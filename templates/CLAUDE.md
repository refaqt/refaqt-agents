# <your repository name>

Full guide: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Do this first, before anything else

This repository keeps its shared rules and skills in the submodule `.agents/`. A session
often starts with that folder empty, and nothing warns you.

Run this in the folder that holds this file:

```bash
ls .agents/rules/core.md
```

If the file is missing, fill the folder, then check again:

```bash
bash setup-agents.sh
```

`setup-agents.sh` needs a network. If it fails, say so in your reply, and say that you are
working without the shared rules.

A start-up hook does the same work, but only when the session opens this folder as its
project folder. A session that opens a parent folder, or that attaches several
repositories, never runs it and never says so. The check above always works.

## Then

Read `.agents/rules/core.md`, `.agents/rules/communication.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.

Write every reply and every file in B2 English: short sentences, common words.

Never commit inside `.agents/`. That folder belongs to its own repository.
