# Fill .agents/ at the start of every session.
#
# Copy this file to .claude/hooks/session-start.sh in your repository root and
# make it executable. The file on its own does nothing: .claude/settings.json is
# what starts it. .cursor/environment.json can run the same file, so Cursor
# cloud agents get the same result from one copy.
#
# Use this file only in a repository that does NOT have a doqs submodule. doqs
# installs its own hook at this exact path and overwrites whatever is there.
#
# Why this exists: a cloud session copies a repository without the contents of
# its submodules, so .agents/ arrives empty. The agent then reads no rules and
# no skills. The folder is there, so nothing looks wrong: the failure is silent,
# which is the worst kind.
#
# What this hook cannot do is start itself. Claude Code reads
# .claude/settings.json from the session's own project folder only. A session
# that opens a parent folder, or that attaches several repositories at once,
# never reads that file, so this hook never runs and prints nothing at all.
# CLAUDE.md carries the check that works in every session. See INSTALL.md,
# step 4.
#
# The two git calls must stay in this order:
#
#   1. --init -- .agents checks the kit out at the commit this repository
#      records. Naming .agents keeps every other submodule untouched.
#   2. --remote -- .agents moves the kit to the latest main.
#
# This hook never stops a session. With no network it says so and exits 0.
