# Planning and quality

## Before coding

- For multi-file work, plan which files change, what is added, edge cases, and side effects before editing.
- Break large features into atomic steps; verify each step before the next.
- Check for existing utilities before adding dependencies, patterns, or abstractions unless the user asks.

## While coding

- Follow naming and structure from adjacent files; keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Handle errors explicitly; do not swallow exceptions silently.
- Do not delete code unless you are certain it is unused; if unsure, comment with `// TODO: remove if confirmed unused`.
- Do not leave debug logs, prints, or commented-out test code in committed files.
- Add comments only when the why is not obvious from the what.

## Testing

- Run existing tests when practical before declaring work complete.
- For new logic, add at least a minimal smoke test unless the user says not to.
- State clearly when a change is untested and why.
