# Subagents

## Delegation

- Before spawning a subagent, define scope, inputs, expected outputs, and failure conditions.
- Subagents must not exceed scope; if work is out of scope, stop and report back.
- Each subagent returns a short completion report: done, skipped, and issues found.
- Subagents do not call other subagents unless the workflow explicitly requires it.

## Coordination

- The orchestrating agent owns final integration; validate subagent output before merging.
- Parallel subagents must not edit the same file; assign disjoint file ownership first.
- Subagents have read access by default; grant write access explicitly per task.

## Safety

- Pause for user confirmation before deleting files, running migrations, or changing environment configuration.
